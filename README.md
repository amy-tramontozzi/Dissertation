I scraped historical Indian meteorological data in Python and constructed an original empirical
framework to evaluate the existence of moral hazard within the Indian crop insurance system for
my senior-year dissertation. This repository includes all the compiled data that were used, as well as an R script that merges and cleans the datasets. The modeling is included in a STATA Do-file.
